<h2>Summary</h2>
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript have been used in pure (without frameworks and libraries) in order to create a cinema seat selector website that works on desktops, tablets, and phones responsively.


<h2>Solution</h2>
<ul>
<li>utilizing semantic element required attributes in order to create accessible webpages;</li>
<li>using relative size units and media query to make the website responsive;</li>
<li>Applying  Grid and Flex methods for constructing a flow and user-friendly web structure;</li>
<li>using JS to make the UI interactive with user activities;</li>
<li>employing simplest codes to keep the website faster and search engine friendly;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Approach</h2>
I created index.html as a base of my construction. Then, I gave it colors and made it decorative with CSS, and got it to be usable by guest visitors with the help of vanilla JavaScript.
This project's UI was inspired by <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2367699-Book-a-Movie" target="_blank">Book a Movie</a>
